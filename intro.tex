\section{Introduction}

Software is arguably the most complicated and varied kind of artifact
humans produce.
%
People who make software at the highest professional level think
deeply about the meaning and correctness of the programs they write.
%
A command of software design at this level requires developing an
understanding of how we give meaning to phrases of a programming language
and how to build analytic tools for proving properties of programs.

This course covers basic theoretical ideas and practical techniques
for modeling and analyzing programming languages; and leveraging those
techniques to mechanically reason about programs.

%% A \deftech{program property} is a predicate on programs.
%% %
%% A program property $P$ is \deftech{semantic} (or \deftech{extensional}) if
%% \[
%% p \simeq q \Rightarrow (P(p) \iff P(q))
%% \]
%% A program property $P$ is \deftech{trivial} if $P(p)$ for all $p$, or
%% $\neg P(p)$ for all $p$.

%% Rice's theorem: Let $L$ be a Turing-complete programming language, $P$
%% a non-trivial semantic program property.  The $P$ is
%% undecidable.\footnote{Classes of recursively enumerable sets and their
%%   decision problems, H.~.G.~Rice, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 74 (1953),
%%   358-366.}

%% A static analysis: given $P$, a semantic program property and $(S,S')$, a static analysis for $P$.

%% Soundness $S \subseteq P$, $S' \subseteq \neg P$
